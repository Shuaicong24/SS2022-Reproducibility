* Time (in minutes) needed to read the paper:

## Availability

* [ ] Artifact is archived in a public archive with a long-term retention policy (which one(s)?)
* [ ] Artifact is available on a different website (which one(s)?)
* [ ] Artifact is available in the version that was submitted to artifact evaluation
* [ ] Artifact is available in the version that passed artifact evaluation
* [x] Artifact is available in a public version control system - Github https://github.com/AndroidTestBugReport/ReCDroid
* [ ] Artifact is available in a self-contained form (container, VM)
* Time (in minutes) needed for the check: 5

### Checks performed

1. Artifact is directly accessible from provided link
2. Check my PC for pre-requirements mentioned in README

### Observations

1. Hardware (memory) requirements didn't fit. Marked this artifact as hardware-unavailable.

## Artifact Type

<!-- Please indicate the artifact type. Multiple selection possible. -->

* [ ] Code
* [ ] Dataset
* [ ] Automated proof
* [ ] Manual proof
* [ ] Other (please specify)
* Time (in minutes) needed for the check:

### Checks performed

<!-- Note all checks you performed here to answer the above questions -->

### Observations

<!-- Note all observations (negative, neutral, or positive) made -->

## Functional

<!-- Venues before 2017 did not have the ACM badges. Therefore, the calls for artifacts usually do not contain explicit criteria for functional/reusable. In this case, please use the definitions and criteria from the ACM artifact evaluation/badging website. -->

* [ ] Artifact is considered functional
* [ ] Artifact is NOT considered functional

## Reusable

### Observations

<!-- Note all observations (negative, neutral, or positive) made -->

## Result reproducibility with the artifact

<!-- Please start with results that the artifact documentation claims to be reproducible. If no such claims can be found, please note this in the observations. After that, please check which results/conclusion are supported by the artifact and which ones are not (irrespective of the results in the paper actually match your observations with t
he artifact). In the last step, please check which of the supported results/conclusions match. -->

### To which degree *can* the artifact support claims from the paper?

<!-- Sometimes the artifact only produces parts of the paper's results. Please indicate the overlap of paper results and what the artifact is able to produce. -->

* [ ] Results from the paper are fully supported by the artifact (i.e., it should in theory be possible to reproduce all results from the paper)
* [ ] Results from the paper are partially supported by the artifact
* [ ] Results from the paper are not supported by the artifact

### To which degree *does* the artifact support the claims it *can* support?

<!-- From the claims that are supported, which fraction can be reproduced with the artifact? -->

* [ ] Results that are supported by the artifact could be fully reproduced
* [ ] Results that are supported by the artifact could be partially reproduced
* [ ] Results from the paper could not be reproduced
* Time (in minutes) needed for the check:

### Observations

<!-- Note all observations (negative, neutral, or positive) made -->
<!-- In case of partial result reproduction, please state what did and did not work -->
